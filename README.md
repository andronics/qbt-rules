## What is qbt-rules?

Left unattended, a qBittorrent instance turns into digital clutter: uncategorized downloads, dead torrents nobody's seeding anymore, ratio requirements quietly going unmet, the occasional file you really didn't want finishing before you noticed. qbt-rules automates all of that away — you write what you want to happen as declarative YAML, and it keeps enforcing it, whether that's the moment a torrent lands, on a schedule, or whenever you trigger it by hand.

**Key Features:**

- **Declarative YAML rules** — no coding required
- **Reusable references** — define a variable, condition, or action sequence once under `refs:`, reuse it everywhere ([docs](https://github.com/andronics/qbt-rules/wiki/Reusable-References))
- **Free-form execution contexts** — webhooks, cron sweeps, manual runs; no fixed trigger list ([docs](https://github.com/andronics/qbt-rules/wiki/Contexts))
- **Rich conditions** — AND/OR/NOT groups, 17+ operators, dot-notation access to 8 qBittorrent API categories
- **Idempotent actions** — safe to run repeatedly
- **Multi-version qBittorrent support** — v4.1 through v5.1+ via `qbittorrent-api`'s auto-detection

**How it works:** a small HTTP server, backed by a persistent SQLite or Redis job queue and a background worker, evaluates your rules and executes actions — categorize, tag, pause, resume, delete, throttle — against qBittorrent. Jobs survive server restarts, and the whole thing ships as a single Docker image (amd64/arm64, GHCR) with no PyPI package or manual install for end users.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- qBittorrent with Web UI enabled

### Create `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  qbt-rules:
    image: ghcr.io/andronics/qbt-rules:latest
    container_name: qbt-rules
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
    environment:
      QBT_RULES_SERVER_API_KEY: "your-secure-api-key-here"  # Change this!
      QBT_RULES_QBITTORRENT_HOST: "http://qbittorrent:8080"
      QBT_RULES_QBITTORRENT_USERNAME: "admin"
      QBT_RULES_QBITTORRENT_PASSWORD: "adminpass"
```

Default `config.yml`/`rules.yml` are created automatically in `/config` on first run if they don't already exist.

### Start it

```bash
docker-compose up -d
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
```

### Your first rule

Edit `config/rules.yml`:

```yaml
rules:
  - name: "Auto-categorize HD movies"
    enabled: true
    stop_on_match: true
    context: torrent-imported
    conditions:
      all:
        - field: info.name
          operator: matches
          value: '(?i).*(1080p|2160p|4k).*'
    actions:
      - type: set_category
        params:
          category: "Movies-HD"
      - type: add_tag
        params:
          tags: [hd, auto-categorized]
```

### Run it

```bash
# Dry-run first
docker exec qbt-rules qbt-rules --dry-run --context torrent-imported --wait

# For real
docker exec qbt-rules qbt-rules --context torrent-imported --wait

# Or via the HTTP API directly
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5000/api/execute?context=torrent-imported&key=your-api-key"
```
